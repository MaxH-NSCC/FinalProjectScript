# FinalProjectScript

When I ran this, I got a message along the lines of...
Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontened. It is held by process 2607 (unatteneded-upgr)...
Originally I looked for a fix but while I was looking for it it worked out.

So! If you run into that same issue, maybe give it a couple of minutes and it should sort itself out.
